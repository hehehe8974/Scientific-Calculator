# Python Tetris
Scientific Calculator built in Python by Taehyun Lee. I think that this is a very simple project to learn Python and utilize it. 
I do not offer any licenses for this project.
## How it is made
I tried to create a calculator that functions almost the same as the scientific calculator that I have. Built this by using the 'eval' function, allowing the calculator to work with more complicated calculations.
Multiple situations were considered for errors, such as the number of closed brackets, that works on a normal scientific calculator while it crashes Python.
The operations are appended into a list for the delete function to be working.
## How to use it
Click the buttons for them to be in the operator. Clicking the equal sign would then evaluate what's in the operator. Shift button allows the user for more functions and unit button allows the user to convert units freely (shift button will change the order).
The user may choose the trig functions to be in degrees or in radians.
