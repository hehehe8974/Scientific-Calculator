# Scientific Calculator
Scientific Calculator built in Python by Taehyun Lee.
I do not offer any licenses for this project.
## How it is made
Created a calculator with unit conversions using Python. Built using the 'eval' function (while handling potential risks), allowing the calculator to work with more complicated calculations.
Multiple situations are considered for errors - such as the number of closed brackets - that cause problems typically in Python.
The operations are appended into a stack, which allows deleting operations more simple.
## How to use it
Click the buttons for the numbers/operations to be in the operator. Clicking the equal sign evaluates what is in the operator. Shift button allows the user for more functions and unit button allows the user to convert units freely (shift button will change the order).
The user may choose the trig functions to be in degrees or in radians.
